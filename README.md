# vcf-comparator
Tools to parse and automatically compare multiple vcf to find the common mutation


## Extract a VCF file into a CSV
First the data need to be extracted in a vcf file.\
To do this put all the vcf files in the same folder as the schell script and run it with these commands:\
```chmod +x data_grepper.sh``` (allows the shell script to be executed)\
```./data_grepper.sh``` (executes the shell script)\
The resulting file is called oscur.txt and can be read as a csv with tabulation as separator.

## Read the CSV file and fuse it together
To read the CSV file call the `open_file(path: str) -> pd.DataFrame` function which takes a path to the CSV file generated by `data_grepper.sh` as argument, it generates a pandas dataframe.<br><br>
To compare the different mutation use the `merge_formater(df: pd.DataFrame)` function which takes a pandas DataFrame opened by the `open_file` function.
